The Excel file contains the 24-hr views of Sony's Action Genre Titles  from 2015 to 2024 and their first trailer asset.
the PowerBI file contains the Analysis that I did.
so to point out the trends that I noticed:
 Superhero Movies (Comic) always tend to have more O&O contribution to the Total Views generated.
 Both YT and FB views are following lower trends but not in a definite pattern (there are some exceptions).
